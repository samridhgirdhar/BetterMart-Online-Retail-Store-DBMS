# BetterMart Online Retail Store
We have incorporated the database in the form of an application where we have tried to resemble it into an E-commerce website which is in a running form where users,sellers, and Administrators can work as they want in a real-life Platform. We have made the Front end to enable the User Interface and User Experience to the best of our abilities. Here our users can actually interact with our website and do changes as they want to according to their scope in the project. It ranges from selling and buying for users to make changes for Administrators and for Sellers for selling their products. It also enables the site to work with all the necessary constraints to put up an actual E-commerce site. We have connected the Database to our actual website which maintains the recording accordingly, if we do any basic change some change happens in or database.
